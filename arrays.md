# Array and substring questions
##  Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
### Given a string "s", find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
```
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        n = len(s)
        ans = 0
        # mp stores the current index of a character
        mp = {}

        i = 0
        # try to extend the range [i, j]
        for j in range(n):
            if s[j] in mp:
                i = max(mp[s[j]], i)

            ans = max(ans, j - i + 1)
            mp[s[j]] = j + 1

        return ans
```

## Container With Most Water
### You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]). Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water. Return the maximum amount of water a container can store. Notice that you may not slant the container.
```
class Solution(object):
    def maxArea(self, height):
        max_area = 0
        l = 0
        r = len(height) - 1
        while l < r:
            area = (r - l) * min(height[r], height[l])
            max_area = max(max_area, area)
            if height[l] < height[r]:
                l += 1
            else:
                r -= 1
        return max_area
```
